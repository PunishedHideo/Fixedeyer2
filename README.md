This macros/script(whatever you call it) was made for autistic game called LIFEWEB made on byond engine. Not tested ingame.

This project needs RobotJS lib that require Windows Build Tools to work. If you can't install dependencies please consider looking into 'https://robotjs.io/docs/building'

To activate: after installing dependencies, cd into folder and type 'node .'. The program will run. It should start turning after you press 'CTRL + G' combo.(Works both ways on/off)
It should work along the 'G' button press in LFWB but actually you need to rebind it to 'CTRL + G' if it is possible, so it can work without any issue(You can even change what triggers it in the source or use ahk script if you want)
